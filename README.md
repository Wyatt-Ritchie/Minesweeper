# Classic Minesweeper in my 2d Engine
<br>
This is just a quick project I wanted to work on to test some AI pathfinding algorithms. My initial idea is to use the A* algorithm for clearing sections of the board. Since the idea is that we want to check each tile and determine if it is adjacent to a mine or not. The A* algorithm should be ideal since that algorithm checks all possible paths. Generally you would then retrieve the reverse of the algo for a pathfinding system, but this game does not need to find a path, it just needs to touch all valid tiles on the game board.
